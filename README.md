Icarus Analysis System
======================
This is @Michcioperz's set of not really useful programs that he uses to make himself feel more like a super secret agent spy scientist. Stuff he made when he was bored.

Icarus is a pun on something. You won't figure out. It's nothing personal, you just won't, cause you have no idea what the hell.
