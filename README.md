* __Halp__ - Launch poweroff command, but give me time to change my mind, and also be funny.
 * _Name's origin:_ I was bored so I threw `halp` at my console and it said it can't. Also, it's kind of a wrapper around `halt`.
 * _Dependencies:_ Python 3, Espeak, Tty, Poweroff
* __Ttyid__ - Welcome user to the system.
 * _Dependencies:_ Python 3, Espeak, Tty, Whoami

Special thanks

* @Folis, who added a fix that flushes console different way and counts stars different way
