It is way too hot in here.
It is that time of the year when there are tons of new video games.
I know lots of books.
I realized there are lots of science-fiction movies I have not seen.
I have not watched that yet.
I have a Biology test tomorrow.
Anything is better than Geography.
Everything is better than anything.
Random thunderstorm passed through not long ago.
Lightning was striking around the Shard quite a lot!
It is just weird.
I think that they have reasons not to.
I saw it.
I figured it out.
There is thunderstorm coming, cause I just woke up.
What is that?
A few sandwiches later I am not that sad and totally not empty.
I was hungry.
I should not have watched a whole season within 24 hours.
Now I am feeling empty and the tea does not help.
Maybe I am just hungry. Or maybe I am sad.
I am not sure about it.
I do not listen to good advices.
I listen to Japanese music.
I like anime.
That reminds me that I should learn all the languages I wanted to learn.
You remind me that I hate the world.
You reminded me of Spotify.
She reminded me of myself.
I am Michi.
You are boring.
You are not like me.
She does not seem to like me.
She seems to be watching me.
I am not just an ordinary person.
You are not right.
They are wrong.
She is right.
He is a bad person.
A few minutes later it was over.
She is cute.
He is not.
She is a miracle.
I think I am in love.
She is a girl.
He is a boy.
She is female.
He is male.
I enjoy writing this database.
This nicely sums up why independent developers enjoy working with them.
Thank you.
Thank them, not me.
